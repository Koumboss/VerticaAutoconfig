# VerticaAutoconfig
Small Ansible script for automatically configuring OS level prerequisites on all VMs before installation.

## Before running the script
1. Make sure to use the root user and that passwordless ssh is enabled. Otherwise, run the following command from your initiator server towards all Vertica nodes :
```
# Replace the IP with each IP of your cluster
ssh-copy-id 10.30.30.23
```
2.  In order to run the script, it is essential to have Ansible installed, to have a root account and to install the Vertica RPM and to drop it in a dedicated path.
3. Install Python and its command line tool pip3
```
yum install -y python39
```
4. Install Ansible using pip3
```
pip3 install ansible
```
